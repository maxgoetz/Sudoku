## Sudoku ##

This project is a Sudoku game written in Java with a fully functioning GUI.

### Summary ###

The program follows the MVC design pattern. It is broken into 3 parts, the model, the control, and the view. The model is composed of interfaces and classes to represent a local puzzle, full puzzle, and puzzle library. Running the main class will invoke the view to create a sudoku interface where you can switch between with a predetermined set of puzzles. The player has the option to go to the next puzzle, previous puzzle, or a random puzzle. There is a control board to the right that allows the player to set the value of any space to a number 1-9 and remove numbers from spaces.
